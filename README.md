# Rock Paper Scissor
This is an exercise from The Odin Projected fundamental javascript course. The objective is to build a simple game called rock-paper-scissor using the browser console. 

In this exercise I've used variables, conditions, functions, array and worked with random values to accomplish the task.

## New feature 1.0
The project was updated with a new feature: User Interface. Now instead of playing in the console the player can play with buttons.

I think that adding features to this game was a big challenge. I've learned so much things fixing bugs and working with solutions by my own. I am proud to make it.
